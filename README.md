# BTP- FONT RECOGNITION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS

Introduction :
Font recognition is the process of identifying and classifying different fonts in images or scanned documents. With thousands of fonts available, traditional methods struggle to recognize them accurately, especially when fonts are similar or distorted. Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has proven to be a powerful approach because it can automatically learn features from images instead of relying on fixed rules.

Motivation:
1.Enhancing OCR Accuracy for Diverse Fonts

MODEL ARCHITECTURE USED:
LeNet-5

USED PYTHON SCRIPT TO GENERATE FONT IMAGES OF DATASETS :
data_collection.py
